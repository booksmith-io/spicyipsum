# Project Instructions for Claude Code

## IMPORTANT: Always Read First

When working on this codebase, **ALWAYS** read and follow the paradigms guide before doing any work:

- **`.claude/paradigms-guide.md`** - Contains all programming patterns and project layout for the project

## Quick Reference

- When in doubt, check existing files and adhere to existing patterns for similar files.  For example:
    - if modifying or adding a file in the `routes` directory, follow existing patterns in other files found in that directory
    - if modifying or adding a file in the `models` directory, follow existing patterns in other files found in that directory
    - follow existing patterns not exclusively defined here

## Workflow

1. **READ** `.claude/paradigms-guide.md` first
2. **CHECK** existing similar files for examples
3. **APPLY** the documented patterns consistently
4. **VERIFY** against the guide when complete
