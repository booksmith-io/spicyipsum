        </div>
        <p>Cookies aren't used through spicyipsum since no persistent data is stored or required for your access.  Although we're always advocating for clear consent and an informed experience for all parties, there's no cookie consent banner to agree to.  There's nothing hidden or sneaky; what you see is what you get.</p>
        <p>There are also no third party trackers or ad brokers like Facebook or Google.  We do, however, use a lightweight, privacy-aware, self-hosted web analytics platform called <a href="https://www.goatcounter.com/" target="_blank">GoatCounter</a> to track simple website access.  Because no personally identifiable information is collected through GoatCounter or this site, spicyipsum doesn't require a GDPR consent notice.</p>
